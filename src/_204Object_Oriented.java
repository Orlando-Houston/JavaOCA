}
//BCE
//Option A, the object is reusable.
//
//Option B, subclass (class) can of course inherit the parent category
// (otherwise how there will be a parent-child relationship).
//
//With option C, objects can share behavior with other objects via
// static class methods, the same parent class methods, or interface methods.
//
//Option D does not specify that the package must have at least one
// category, and nothing can be placed or interfaced.
//
//Option E, “Object” is the top level of all categories of objects.
// If the category does not use extends to specify which category to inherit,
// the “Object” category is automatically inherited.
//
//Option F does not stipulate that each category must have a “main” method.
