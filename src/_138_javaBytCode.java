//E. It can run on any platform only if that platform has both the Java Runtime Environment and a Java

//Answer: D

    //Java bytecodes help make "write once, run anywhere" possible. You can compile your program into
    //bytecodes on any platform that has a Java compiler. The bytecodes can then be run on any implementation
    //of the Java VM. That means that as long as a computer has a Java VM, the same program written in the
    //Java programming language can run on Windows 2000, a Solaris workstation, or on an iMac.

//    The bytecode is actually the already compiled java file which has the .
//    class extension. So it can run in any platform that has the runtime environment.

//    JVM (or compiler) compiles Java source code into bytecode.
//However this question is about the following step: The system needs
// JRE in order to interpret the bytecode and run it on the system.
//So the correct answer should b C
